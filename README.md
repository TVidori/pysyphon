# pysyphon



pysyphon is the package created by Sypher ([sypher.ai]()) for data loading both from external sources (marketing tools such as Salesforce or Hubspot) and into our data infrastructure (PostgreSQL, MongoDB....). While many packages for moving data exist, the goal of this package is not to work as a standalone but to be used within Python code by easing the collect and storage of data.



Work is still in progress. How to install the package and use it, guidlines for contributing and many more documentation will be added later on. 

If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact thomas@sypher.ai
